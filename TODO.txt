1. add verifications of success\failure to all MQ and other functions
2. check a way to implement strtok with while loop and array of ptr's to fields of bitcoin.
3. add verifications and print msg when sent or\and rcv Q's are full.
4. in string production consider the folowing :
	//while( token != NULL ) {
    //	token = strtok(NULL, s);
    //	some struct of pointers to fields of block = token;
	//}
5. Generate Program False Loop Proccess (from Ex2) and decide when to activate it and how many times?
6. change servers Q name from MQ_NAME to something logical in all places.
7. maybe turn the connection between server and miner to happen in the function initiate_connection_with_server.
